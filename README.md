## Overview

I have completed Requirements 1-7. You can see my web application by running and going to localhost:8112. I had to change to port number because a bug where I couldn't see changes in my code on previously used port numbers. For requirements 1-4, I used aggregations by making an Hashmap where the keys are the column name and pairs are Column instances in DataFrame and used association by making a DataFrame inside Model (see below).

For requirement 7, I allowed the user to sort the table by a field, either ascending or descending. This allows the user to see certain info such as who is the oldest person (sorting by DOB) and people living in a certain state (by sorting by STATE and going to that state).

readability, reproducabilty, scalability, exception and error handling, 

OOP: cohesion, abstraction, encapsulation, single responsability principle, writing to an interfaces.
